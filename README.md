# Jasmine Unit Testing

### This repo is to learn about how to use, and setup tests in Jasmine. It's built on top of my (ES6 Boilerplate repo)[https://github.com/tomroper/es6-babel-gulp-boilerplate]


### Initial setup

```bash
# Clone the repo...
git clone https://github.com/tomroper/jasmine-tests.git
cd jasmine-tests

# Then, you need to install all the dependencies...
npm install

# If you wanna be able to use global commands `karma` and `gulp`...
npm install -g gulp
```

### Running in the browser
```bash
gulp build
gulp serve

# If you wanna Gulp to re-build on every change...
gulp watch
```
